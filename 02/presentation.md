  - Embedded projects, e.g. [m5stack](https://flow.m5stack.com/)

---

## pro block programming

- easily written
- easily read
- can be converted to code

---

## cons block programming

- extremely verbosive

- limited
  - complexity
  - functionality
  - features

---

## looking into it 1

- scratch: go to [scratch.mit.edu/pro](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/) and explore the block editor


---

## around the block 1

- Scratch: let's "walk around the block"
  - move the character around
  - walk in the pattern of a square
  - elements to use:
    - move "100" steps
    - turn 90 degrees
    - wait 1 second

## around the block 2

- improve
- additional elements to use:

---

## Repeats

- What could we use repeats for?

---

- additional elements to use:
  - custom blocks
